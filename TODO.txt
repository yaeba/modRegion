change usage to allow not just query of a single region but multiple regions from files or flags (DONE)

main.R extract ... (DONE)

add more flexible plotting flag, --title (DONE)
for plotting, change smoothing to per-read smoothing, (DONE)
## if the region is too short, when plotting, chances of error "span is too small" (temporary switched back to global span value)

write OOP manner (DONE)

main.R overlap ... (DONE)

add usage of finding overlap with proteins from gtf (DONE)

and plotting (DONE)

silent warning messages by ggbio::tracks

make calling ./modRegion.R possible from other dirs, sourcing prob (DONE)

filter gtf to interested regions before converting to genes only?

add modRegion.R plot to plot from queried/filtered tsv (DONE)

optimise find overlap (current implementation materialize altrep) lose advantage in RAM usage

vroom does not index numeric vectors (altrep=false), can consider reading and indexing as characters first

filter_regions has high memory consumption during the process, and vroom does not play nicely with dplyr::filter (will materialize columns afterwards), consider using slicing?

documentation? (DONE)

make subsampling during overplotting

load_nanopolish has "_Basecall_1D_template" at the end of every read_id
